**ssl:** Set to true to use SSL connection.  
**nick:** Your IRC nick.  
**ident-password:** The password required to identify your IRC nick to NickServ. If it's not already registered, autodl-irssi will attempt to register it for you.  
**ident-email:** Optional. Required if autodl-irssi needs to register your nick.
