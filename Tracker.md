**TYPE**
> **TYPE** can be found in the **type="XYZ"** line in the corresponding tracker file in **~/.irssi/scripts/AutodlIrssi/trackers/**.

**enabled**
> Default (unset) is true. Set it to false to disable the tracker.

**force-ssl**
> Not all trackers support HTTPS downloads. Leave it blank for the default value (which is HTTP or HTTPS).

**upload-delay-secs**
> Set the number of seconds autodl-irssi should wait before uploading/saving the torrent. Default is 0 (no wait).

**cookie**
> Log in to your tracker's home page with your browser.
* Chrome: Options Menu -> Privacy -> Content Settings -> All cookies and site data
* Firefox: Firefox Menu -> Options -> Privacy -> Show cookies

> It's usually just **uid=XXX; pass=YYY**. Separate each key=value pair with a semicolon.

**passkey**
> First check a torrent download link if it contains it. If not you can usually find it in the generated RSS-feed URL, which you probably can generate @ yourtracker.com/getrss.php . passkeys are usually exactly 32 characters long. The passkey can also sometimes be found in your profile (click your name).

**authkey**
> See **passkey** above. For gazelle sites, it's part of the torrent download link.

**torrent_pass**
> For gazelle sites, it's part of the torrent download link.

**uid**
> Click your username and you should see the id=XXX in the address bar. That's your user id, or uid.
