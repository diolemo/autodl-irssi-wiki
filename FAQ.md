### How do I get a new tracker added to autodl-irssi?
If you know how to create a new tracker file or edit an existing tracker file to suit your needs, you can submit a Pull Request to the [trackers repository](https://github.com/autodl-community/autodl-trackers) following the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/autodl-community/autodl-trackers/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-code). If you need it to be created by a member of autodl-community, [submit an issue](https://github.com/autodl-community/autodl-trackers/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-an-issue) to the [trackers repository](https://github.com/autodl-community/autodl-trackers) or come to the IRC channel in the footer with the following information:

* Tracker name
* Tracker abbreviation (if applicable)
* Tracker IRC server address
* Tracker IRC announce channel
* Tracker IRC announcer name
* A decent size sampling of announces from the announce channel (at least 5-10)

Preferably, this information should be provided using a pastebin site.
